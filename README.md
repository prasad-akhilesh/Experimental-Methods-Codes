Lab Projects carried out for completion of the course MCL705 - Experimental Methods

Set of projects that needs to be carried out as part of completion of the course:
1) Uncertainty Analysis of Heat Exchanger
2) Estimating the viscosity of SAE fluids using Image Processing in MATLAB
3) Estimating the convective heat transfer coefficient for cooling of an Al cylinder
4) Creating a setup for measuring coefficient of friction between two surfaces and measuring the uncertainty for the same.

Some theory of Uncertainty Analysis and Propagation which is common:
